# login-with-email-or-login-with-google-using-django
This is a custom user login/registration project.

  ## Features of project:

  1. **Login with Email**. By default, django gives 'username' field for login but I customized user model sothat User can login with thier 'Email'.

  2. **Login with Google**. Here user can login without entering password just like real websites use "Login with Google". But you need 'API Key' and 'Secret Key' from google developer website and place it in your app.

  3. **Goto Profile Update Page without reloading page**.

  ## Technologies Used:

  * Python
  * Django
  * Jquery
  * Bootstrap
  * CSS
  * HTML
